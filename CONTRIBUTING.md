# Contributing to Awesome Claude Code

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This list aims to be the most comprehensive and high-quality resource for the Claude Code ecosystem.

## Guidelines

### What qualifies as "awesome"?

Research has shown that "weights" are important for any curated list. Only suggest things you have personally used or thoroughly evaluated. Items should be genuinely useful to Claude Code users, not just tangentially related.

### Adding a new resource

1. **Search existing entries** to make sure the resource is not already listed.
2. **Fork this repository** and create a new branch.
3. **Add your resource** in the appropriate section, following the existing format:
   ```markdown
   - [Name](https://github.com/owner/repo) - Short description (one sentence, no period). ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/owner/repo)
   ```
4. **Submit a pull request** using the PR template.

### Format requirements

- Use the exact format: `[Name](link) - Description. ![GitHub Repo stars](badge)`
- Descriptions should be concise (one sentence) and start with a capital letter.
- Descriptions should not start with "A" or "An" unless grammatically necessary.
- Do not include trailing periods in descriptions (the badge follows).
- Place new entries at the end of the relevant section.
- Check your spelling and grammar.

### Adding a new section

If your resource does not fit any existing section:

1. Open an issue first to discuss the proposed section.
2. Sections should have at least 3 items before being created.
3. Add the section to the Table of Contents.

### Quality standards

Resources must meet these criteria:

- **Active maintenance** - The project should show recent activity (commits within the last 6 months).
- **Documentation** - Must have a README with clear setup and usage instructions.
- **Relevance** - Must be directly useful to Claude Code users.
- **No duplicates** - Check that the resource is not already listed under a different name.
- **Working links** - All URLs must be valid and accessible.
- **Real projects** - No placeholder or template-only repos with no real functionality.

### Removing a resource

If you find a resource that is:

- No longer maintained (archived or 12+ months without commits)
- Broken or inaccessible
- No longer relevant to Claude Code

Please open a PR to remove it, explaining the reason in the PR description.

## Code of Conduct

By contributing, you agree to be respectful and constructive. Spam, self-promotion without substance, and offensive content will not be accepted.

## Questions?

Open an issue if you have questions about whether a resource fits or which section it belongs in.
